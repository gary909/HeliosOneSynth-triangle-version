"# HeliosOneSynth-triangle-version" 

________________________________________

About:
This contains the same code as 4.6 final version but contains a Triangle wave instead of the Saw

________________________________________

Changes made:

line 100 - Import the Triangle.h file (muted the saw on line 98)

line 152 - Add the Tri Osc to the code (name it oscil1), again muted the saw code on line 150

line 241 - Added the Tri Osc to the Switch that changes between oscillators (and removed the Saw on 240)
